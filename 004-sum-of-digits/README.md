# Challenge 004: Sum of Digits

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program that reads a **positive integer** and calculates the **sum of its digits**.

This simple program is useful in various digital root calculations, checksum formulas, and beginner number theory tasks.

## Requirements

- Read a **positive integer** (you may assume the user always enters a valid number).
- Compute and print the **sum of its digits**.
- You may read the number as an integer or as a string if you prefer.
- Do not use any external libraries for summing.

## Example

### Input
```
1005
```
### Output
```
Sum of digits: 6
```

## Note
- Optional: Add input validation to reject negative numbers.
- Bonus: Try both implementations â€” one using modulo (`%`) and integer division, and another using string iteration.
