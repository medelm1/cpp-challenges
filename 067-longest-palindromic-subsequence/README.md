# Challenge 067 - Longest Palindromic Subsequence

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to find the length of the **longest palindromic subsequence** in a given string.

## Requirements

- Accept a string input.
- Use dynamic programming to find the longest palindromic subsequence.
- Return the length of the subsequence.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter a string: bbbab
```
### Output
```
Length of longest palindromic subsequence: 4
```
_Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb"._
