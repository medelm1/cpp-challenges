# Challenge 064 - Find Peak Element in Array

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to find **any peak element** in an array.

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. For corner elements, consider only one neighbor.

## Requirements

- Accept the size and elements of the array.
- Implement an efficient algorithm (binary search) with O(log n) time complexity.
- Return the index and value of any one peak element.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter array size: 5  
Enter array elements: 1 3 20 4 1
```
### Output
```
Peak element is 20 at index 2
```
