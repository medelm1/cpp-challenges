# Challenge 062 - Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to find the length of the **longest strictly increasing subsequence** in an array.

## Requirements

- Accept the size and elements of the array.
- Implement an efficient solution (O(nÂ²) or better).
- Return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter array size: 8  
Enter elements: 10 9 2 5 3 7 101 18
```
### Output
```
Length of longest increasing subsequence: 4
```
_Explanation: The LIS is `[2, 3, 7, 101]`._
