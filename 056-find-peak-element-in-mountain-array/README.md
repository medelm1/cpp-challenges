# Challenge 056 - Find Peak Element in Mountain Array

## Problem Statement

Given a **mountain array** (an array where elements increase then decrease), write a C++ program to find the **peak element** — the maximum element in the array.

## Requirements

- Accept the size and elements of the mountain array.
- Use an efficient algorithm (binary search).
- Return the peak element’s value and index.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter array size: 7  
Enter array elements: 1 3 7 8 5 2 0
```
### Output
```
Peak element is 8 at index 3
```
