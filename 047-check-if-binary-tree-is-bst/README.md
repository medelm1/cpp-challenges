# Challenge 047 - Check If Binary Tree Is BST

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to check whether a given binary tree is a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**.

A BST is a binary tree in which for every node, all nodes in the left subtree are smaller, and all nodes in the right subtree are greater.

## Requirements

- Implement a binary tree structure.
- Accept input to construct the tree (can be hardcoded or user input).
- Write a function to verify the BST property.
- Return true if BST, false otherwise.

## Example

### Input (conceptual)
```
Construct tree:
       5
      / \
     3   7
    / \   \
   2   4   8
```
### Output
```
The tree is a valid BST.
```
