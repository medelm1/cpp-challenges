# Challenge 051 - Implement Queue Using Stacks

## Problem Statement

Implement a **queue** using two **stacks** in C++.

The queue should support standard operations:

- `enqueue` (push)
- `dequeue` (pop)
- `peek` (front element)
- `isEmpty`

## Requirements

- Implement the queue operations using two stacks only.
- Maintain the FIFO (first-in-first-out) order.
- Demonstrate the queue functionality with sample inputs.

## Example

### Input
```
Enqueue 1  
Enqueue 2  
Enqueue 3  
Dequeue  
Peek
```
### Output
```
Dequeued element: 1  
Front element: 2
```
