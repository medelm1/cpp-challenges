# Challenge 068 - Find Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray

## Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays, write a C++ program to find the **length of the longest subarray** that appears in both arrays.

## Requirements

- Accept sizes and elements of two arrays.
- Use dynamic programming or efficient algorithms.
- Return the length of the longest common subarray.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter size of first array: 5  
Enter elements: 1 2 3 2 1  

Enter size of second array: 5  
Enter elements: 3 2 1 4 7
```
### Output
```
Length of longest common subarray: 3
```
_Explanation: The longest common subarray is `[3, 2, 1]`._
