# Challenge 049 - Find Kth Largest Element in an Array

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to find the **longest palindromic substring** in a given string.

## Requirements

- Accept a string input from the user.
- Return the longest substring which reads the same forwards and backwards.
- If multiple such substrings exist, return any one of them.
- Optimize for time complexity (optional).

## Example

### Input
```
Enter a string: babad
```
### Output
```
Longest palindromic substring: bab
```
_Note: "aba" is also a valid answer._
