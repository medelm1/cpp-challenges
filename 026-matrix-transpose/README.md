# Challenge 026: Matrix Transpose

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program that takes a 2D matrix of size `m x n` (rows Ã— columns) as input and returns its **transpose**.

The transpose of a matrix is obtained by flipping it over its diagonal. In other words, the row and column indices of each element are swapped.

## Requirements

- Accept the dimensions of the matrix `m` and `n` from the user.
- Accept all the matrix elements from the user.
- Compute the **transpose** of the matrix.
- Display the transposed matrix.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter the number of rows: 2  
Enter the number of columns: 3  

Enter the elements of the matrix:
1 2 3  
4 5 6
```
### Output
```
The transposed matrix is:
1 4  
2 5  
3 6
```
