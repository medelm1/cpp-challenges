# Challenge 071 - Largest Rectangle of 1’s in a Binary Matrix

## Problem Statement

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0’s and 1’s, write a C++ program to find the **largest rectangle containing only 1’s** and return its area.

## Requirements

- Accept the number of rows and columns, and the binary matrix.
- Use an efficient approach (e.g., leveraging largest rectangle in histogram algorithm).
- Print the area of the largest rectangle.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter number of rows: 4  
Enter number of columns: 5  

Enter matrix elements:  
1 0 1 0 0  
1 0 1 1 1  
1 1 1 1 1  
1 0 0 1 0
```
### Output
```
Largest rectangle area: 6
```
