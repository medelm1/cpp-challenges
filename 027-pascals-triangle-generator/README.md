# Challenge 027: Pascal's Triangle Generator

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** up to a given number of rows.

Pascalâ€™s Triangle is a triangular array where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row. The triangle starts with a single `1` at the top.

## Requirements

- Ask the user to enter the number of rows `n`.
- Generate and print Pascal's Triangle up to the `n`th row.
- You may use a 2D array or nested loops.
- Use proper spacing for triangle formatting.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter the number of rows: 5
```
### Output
```
Pascal's Triangle:
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```
