# Challenge 059 - Minimum Path Sum in Grid

## Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, write a C++ program to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

## Requirements

- Accept dimensions `m` and `n` and the grid elements.
- Use dynamic programming to find the minimum path sum.
- Print the minimum sum.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter rows (m): 3  
Enter columns (n): 3  

Enter grid elements:
1 3 1  
1 5 1  
4 2 1
```
### Output
```
Minimum path sum: 7
```
