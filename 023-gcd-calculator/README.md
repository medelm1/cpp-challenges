# Challenge 023: GCD Calculator

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program that calculates the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two positive integers.

## Requirements

- Read two positive integers `a` and `b`.
- Compute and output their GCD.
- Use the **Euclidean algorithm** for efficiency.

## Example

### Input
```
48 18
```
### Output
```
6
```
---
### Input
```
100 25
```
### Output
```
25
```

## Notes

- You can implement the Euclidean algorithm recursively or iteratively.
- Bonus: Create a function `int gcd(int a, int b)` for the calculation.
