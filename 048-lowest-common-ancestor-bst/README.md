# Challenge 048 - Lowest Common Ancestor in BST

## Problem Statement

Given a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and two node values, write a C++ program to find the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** of the two nodes.

The LCA of two nodes is the lowest node in the tree that has both nodes as descendants (a node can be a descendant of itself).

## Requirements

- Implement a BST structure.
- Accept the BST and two node values.
- Find and print the LCA nodeâ€™s value.
- Assume both nodes exist in the BST.

## Example

### Input (conceptual)
```
Construct BST:
       6
      / \
     2   8
    / \ / \
   0  4 7  9

Enter node 1: 2  
Enter node 2: 8
```
### Output
```
Lowest Common Ancestor of 2 and 8 is 6
```
