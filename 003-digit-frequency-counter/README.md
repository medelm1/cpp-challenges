# Challenge 003 – Digit Frequency Counter

## Problem Statement:

Write a C++ program that reads an integer (which may contain up to 18 digits) and counts how many times each digit (0 through 9) appears in it.

## Requirements

- __Input__: A single positive integer (as a string or number).
- __Output__: Print the frequency of each digit from 0 to 9, even if a digit doesn't appear (its count should be 0).
- Avoid using external libraries for counting — just arrays or maps.

## Example

### Input:
```
902348234234230
```

### Output:
```
Digit 0: 2
Digit 1: 0
Digit 2: 4
Digit 3: 4
Digit 4: 3
Digit 5: 0
Digit 6: 0
Digit 7: 0
Digit 8: 1
Digit 9: 1
```
