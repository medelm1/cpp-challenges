# Challenge 006: Multiplication Table

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program that prints the **multiplication table** of a given positive integer up to 10.

This exercise helps reinforce your understanding of loops and basic arithmetic.

## Requirements

- Read a positive integer from the user.
- Print its multiplication table from 1 to 10.
- Format the output as: `n x i = result`

## Example

### Input
```
5
```

### Output
```
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```


## Notes

- You can use a `for` loop from 1 to 10.
- Optional: Add input validation to ensure the number is positive.
