# Challenge 061 - Reorder Array by Parity

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to reorder an array so that **all even numbers come before odd numbers**.

The relative order of even and odd numbers within their groups does **not** need to be preserved.

## Requirements

- Accept the size and elements of the array.
- Rearrange elements **in-place** (no extra array).
- Print the reordered array.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter array size: 8  
Enter elements: 3 1 2 4 7 6 5 8
```
### Output
```
Reordered array: 8 6 2 4 7 1 5 3
```
_(Note: even numbers first, then odd numbers, order inside groups can vary.)_
