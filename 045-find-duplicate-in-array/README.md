# Challenge 045 - Find Duplicate in Array

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to find the **duplicate number** in an array containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is between `1` and `n` (inclusive).

Assume that there is **only one duplicate number**, but it may be repeated more than once.

## Requirements

- Accept the size of the array (`n + 1`) and the elements.
- Find the duplicate number `without modifying the array` and using only constant extra space.
- Return the duplicate number.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter array size: 6  
Enter elements: 1 3 4 2 2 5
```
### Output
```
Duplicate number is: 2
```
