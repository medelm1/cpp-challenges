# Challenge 005: Even or Odd

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program that takes an integer as input and determines whether it is **even** or **odd**.

This is one of the most basic programs to get familiar with conditionals and modular arithmetic.

## Requirements

- Read an integer input (can be negative, zero, or positive).
- Print whether the number is **even** or **odd**.
- Use the modulo operator `%` to check parity.

## Example

### Input:
```
-17
```

### Output:
```
Odd
```

### Input:
```
104
```

### Output:
```
Even
```

## Notes

- Bonus: Wrap the logic in a function called `isEven(int n)` that returns `true` or `false`.
- Optional: Print `Even` or `Odd` using a conditional expression (`?:`) or `if`/`else`.
