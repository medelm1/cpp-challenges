# Challenge 038 - Find Peak Element

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to find a **peak element** in an array.

A peak element is an element that is **greater than its neighbors**. For corner elements, consider only one neighbor.

## Requirements

- Accept the size and elements of the array from the user.
- Find **any one** peak element and print its value and index.
- Implement an efficient algorithm with **O(log n)** time complexity using binary search.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter array size: 5  
Enter array elements: 1 3 20 4 1
```
### Output
```
Peak element is 20 at index 2
```
