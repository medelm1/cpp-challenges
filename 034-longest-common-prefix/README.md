# Challenge 033 - Count Inversions in Array

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program that finds the **longest common prefix** among a set of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string.

## Requirements

- Accept the number of strings `n` and then accept `n` strings from the user.
- Return the **longest prefix** that is common to all strings.
- If no common prefix exists, display an appropriate message.
- Do not use advanced libraries â€” stick to basic string handling.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter number of strings: 4  
Enter the strings:
flower  
flow  
flight  
flame
```
### Output
```
Longest common prefix: fl
```
---
### Input
```
Enter number of strings: 3  
Enter the strings:
dog  
racecar  
car
```
### Output
```
No common prefix found.
