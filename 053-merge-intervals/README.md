# Challenge 053 - Merge Intervals

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to **merge overlapping intervals** in a list of intervals.

## Requirements

- Accept a list of intervals (each interval is two integers: start and end).
- Merge all overlapping intervals.
- Return a list of merged intervals sorted by start time.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter number of intervals: 4  
Enter intervals (start end):  
1 3  
2 6  
8 10  
15 18
```
### Output
```
Merged intervals:  
1 6  
8 10  
15 18
```
