# Challenge 070 - Find Number of Islands

## Problem Statement

Given a 2D grid of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), write a C++ program to count the **number of islands**.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

## Requirements

- Accept grid dimensions and the grid elements.
- Use DFS or BFS to traverse and count islands.
- Print the number of islands found.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter number of rows: 4  
Enter number of columns: 5  

Enter grid:  
1 1 0 0 0  
1 1 0 0 0  
0 0 1 0 0  
0 0 0 1 1
```
### Output
```
