# Challenge 055 - Find Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program to find the **median** of two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be **O(log (m+n))**, where `m` and `n` are the sizes of the two arrays.

## Requirements

- Accept sizes and sorted arrays from the user.
- Find the median of the combined sorted array without merging them explicitly.
- Handle arrays of different lengths, including empty arrays.

## Example

### Input
```
Enter size of first array: 3  
Enter elements of first array: 1 3 5  

Enter size of second array: 4  
Enter elements of second array: 2 4 6 8
```
### Output
```
Median is: 4
```
